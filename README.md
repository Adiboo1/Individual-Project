Instructions for running the servers: 

Open the windows command panel and navigate to this directory. 
Next, further navigate to 'back-end\server' directoy.
Once there, type 'npm run dev', which launches the development environment server.
Next, you can return to the 'figured-out-testing' directory. 
Navigate to 'front-end\Figured-Out' and type 'npm run dev' command again.
This will launch the server for the front-end (React) server.
Now you can open your web-browser and search for 'http://localhost:1803/'. 


Error handling: 

If you find that the search bar is not working, it may be because it is being blocked by CORS. 
In order to fix this, you need to go to the following url: 'chrome://flags/#block-insecure-private-network-requests'.
At the top, there is a setting about blocking inscure requests. Disable this. 
Note: Make sure you re-enable this when you have finished testing, as it can be dangerous to leave it like this.
